Create and android ROM that works on Lumia (Microsoft) phones

So... Microsoft fan here has a Lumia 950XL. I really like, fantasctic camera, fabulous screen, etc.

Overall a nice piece of hardware that Microsoft decided to discontinue by dropping development of Windows 10 Mobile. 

Basically I'm stuck with a really good phone that I struggle to use nowadays given the HUGE app gap.

That said it's time for me to either:
. buy a new phone
. try to use Android on my phone

Anyone willing to help?... Please? Pretty please with sugar on top?! :P
